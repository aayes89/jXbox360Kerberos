# jXbox360Kerberos
First Kerberos server attempt for Xbox 360 authentication.

It allows you to establish authentication in a specific way or any user and password profile you want, there is still a lot to do, but it is a good start.

# How to start
- Import all classes into a new Maven project and change the package to the desired one and play
- 
# TODO
- Append an X509 certificate authentication
- Add a bypass to load signed or unsigned apps, themes and galleries for avatars

# I am not responsible for the use they may give to the code.
